    <div class="container">
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The Drowsiness and Yawning Detection System aims to improve productivity and safety by monitoring users' eye and mouth movements through a webcam. This system provides real-time alerts to help prevent accidents caused by drowsiness and encourages users to take breaks when signs of fatigue are detected. 
        </p>

        <h2>How It Helps Students</h2>
        <p>
            This system is particularly useful for students who spend extended hours studying or working on their laptops. It helps them stay alert and maintain focus during study sessions, promoting healthy study habits. Key benefits for students include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detects when students become drowsy while studying.</li>
            <li>Encourages timely breaks to prevent burnout and maintain productivity.</li>
            <li>Reduces eye strain by monitoring and suggesting rest when needed.</li>
            <li>Improves awareness about their study habits through real-time alerts.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Key Applications</h2>

    <h1>Code Documentation </h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This system uses a Flask-based web application to monitor a person's eye and mouth movements via webcam. It detects signs of drowsiness and yawning using facial landmark analysis through the MediaPipe library. The system provides real-time alerts through text and voice notifications when the user shows signs of drowsiness or yawning.</p>

    <h2>Code Explanation</h2>
    <p>The code is structured as follows:</p>

    <h3>1. Libraries and Initialization</h3>
    <p>The necessary libraries are imported, and variables are initialized for controlling various parameters such as the drowsiness detection thresholds and the state of the mask overlay.</p>

    <h3>2. Eye and Mouth Aspect Ratio Calculation</h3>
    <p>The <strong>calculate_ear()</strong> and <strong>calculate_mar()</strong> functions calculate the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) and Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) from the facial landmarks, which are used for drowsiness and yawning detection.</p>

    <h3>3. Video Stream and FaceMesh Processing</h3>
    <p>The <strong>generate_frames()</strong> function captures frames from the webcam, processes them to extract facial landmarks, and checks the EAR and MAR values to detect drowsiness or yawning. It triggers alerts when these thresholds are exceeded.</p>

    <h3>4. Voice Alert Function</h3>
    <p>The <strong>voice_alert()</strong> function generates a voice alert using gTTS and plays it through pygame.</p>

    <h3>5. Flask Routes</h3>
    <p>Several Flask routes are defined to handle different functionalities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>/toggle_mask</strong> – Toggles the display of the facial landmarks on the video feed.</li>
        <li><strong>/alerts</strong> – Returns the most recent alert message (if any).</li>
        <li><strong>/video_feed</strong> – Streams the webcam feed with face landmarks and alerts.</li>
        <li><strong>/start</strong> – Starts the drowsiness and yawning detection process.</li>
        <li><strong>/stop</strong> – Stops the drowsiness and yawning detection process.</li>
    </ul>

        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Setting</th>
                <th>Default Value</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>EYE_AR_THRESH</td>
                <td>0.25</td>
                <td>The threshold below which drowsiness is detected based on the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>YAWN_THRESH</td>
                <td>0.6</td>
                <td>The threshold above which yawning is detected based on the Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>DURATION_THRESH</td>
                <td>1.5</td>
                <td>The minimum duration (in seconds) for which the EAR or MAR must be below or above the threshold to trigger an alert.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This system provides real-time monitoring and alerts for drowsiness and yawning using webcam-based facial landmark analysis. It can be useful for improving alertness during tasks such as driving or operating machinery.</p>
